# SMU_MSDS
Master Repo for Mater's of Science in Data Science work. 

The purpose of this repo is to hold current and past work accumulated while I progress through SMU's MSDS program (https://datascience.smu.edu/)  

The repo will contain:
* Data sets from class
* homework files
* Miscellaneous code snips that I found particularly helpful


In general the repo will follow this setup:
* Under the root directory, there will be class directories
* Class directories will contain at a minimum: a homework sub-directory, and datasets sub-directory
* Class directories may be broken down by unit if there is suffienct data

If there are any questions about my datasets, code, or you just want to say hello send me an email at khthomas@smu.edu
